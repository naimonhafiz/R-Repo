#introduction:The director of admissions of a small college selected 100 studentsat
#random from the new freshman class in a study to determine whether a student's 
#grade point average (GPA) at the end of the freshman year (Y) can be predicted
#from the ACT test score (X).
#Referce:"Applied liner Statistical Model" By Kutner, Michael.

#Primary Analysis:
#1.Determine wether there is liner relationship Between ACT Score and GPA.
#2.Determine the least squares estimates of Beta_zero and Beta_1, 
#and state the estimated regression function.
#3.What is the point estimate of the change in the mean response when the 
#entrance test score increases by one point.
#4. Analysis of vaiance
#5. Diagnosis of perdictor variables and residuals

#Secondary Analysis:
#Most of the time the student having higher Act Score dont end up having higher 
#GPP so the director of admissions of a small college selected 100 student 
#randomly check wether thats really true or not.;
